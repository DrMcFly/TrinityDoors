					<h2>Why Trinity Doors?</h2>
					<p>We take pride in the quality of our craftsmanship and customer service.  Our products designs are limited, as we are laser focused on quality and speed.
						Currently we make 5 piece shaker doors with turn around times at 3 to 10 days depending on how big the order. We will make any door you like, but you might
						have to provide the bit for the style you want.
